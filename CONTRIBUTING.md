**Contributing guidelines**

Contributions to the project are very welcome. To avoid issues with PRs and speed up the process, a few guidelines shall be considered.

1) Avoid unnecessary dependency additions: if there is a good reason to add to dependencies, that is fine, yet have an eye on whether that is the case.
2) Avoid imposing a framework that affects the codebase more widely. The decision to keep frameworks such as Play, Spring and so on out of the project was dont deliberately, following a leaner and more explicit path.
3) Favor local, smaller changes over very long PRs. In doubt try to contribute smaller chunks to reach the end goal. If that doesnt make sense and the changes are more involved, longer PRs are still a possibility.
4) Make sure the code is readable and sufficiently self-explanatory. Favorably via telling names and good composition / short docstrings. Where algorithms become more complex, some documentation might be able to resolve confusion.
5) Add tests
6) Describe the reasoning behind the additions/modifications and your approach in the PR.

Thanks for the effort!
Have a grand day :)
