# When a node is becoming oldest it sends hand-over request to previous oldest,

# The number of retries are derived from hand-over-retry-interval and
# akka.cluster.down-removal-margin (or ClusterSingletonManagerSettings.removalMargin),
# but it will never be less than this property.
# After the hand over retries and it's still not able to exchange the hand over messages
# with the previous oldest it will restart itself by throwing ClusterSingletonManagerIsStuck,
# to start from a clean state. After that it will still not start the singleton instance
# until the previous oldest node has been removed from the cluster.
# On the other side, on the previous oldest node, the same number of retries - 3 are used
# and after that the singleton instance is stopped.
# For large clusters it might be necessary to increase this to avoid too early timeouts while
# gossip dissemination of the Leaving to Exiting phase occurs. For normal leaving scenarios
# it will not be a quicker hand over by reducing this value, but in extreme failure scenarios
# the recovery might be faster.
